        <h2>Assignment</h2>
        <p>
          You will create an “Homage to a Font” layout design.
          You will create the layout design using some of the text (regarding the history, characteristics, and era of your font).
          Using Adobe InDesign, take the text (the history, characteristics, and era of the font) from the short 
          paper you wrote in Module One and arrange the blocks of type into a creative layout design. 
          Use visual hierarchy of text to effectively create visual dominance. 
          Submit the layout as a one page, 300 ppi, landscape (17 x 11 total size) PDF. 
        </p>
          <h2>Design Process</h2>
          <p>
            For my homage design, I really wanted to emphasize that this font was created for the BBC network. 
            I accomplished this by putting their logo nice and big on the left of the paper. I then knew I didn’t 
            want a strictly white background, so I decided to create a color block by using the rectangle tool. 
            I played around with it a lot until I positioned it to my liking and would help create some negative 
            space around the big elements. The colors I chose was also methodical. I wanted to use those earthy 
            colors to represent the networks popular Earth subdivision. For the bigger block of text, I chose to 
            justify it with the last line justified left because I wanted to continue the square theme coming 
            from the logo. I made sure to choose a font size that would complement the bounding text box as well 
            as make it easily readable. I then moved onto the other elements. I originally was going to have the 
            alphabet with a 5% transparency as the background, but I thought that since this is a homage, I should 
            display it more rather than use it as a background. I also justified both the upper and lowercase to 
            continue the box feel. I did adjust the leading to add some space between the lines because they were a
            little too on top of each other. I did use the grid and rulers a lot for this homage piece. I tried 
            aligning the titles to the text height. I used font size and color to help me with the visual hierarchy.  
            I wanted to include a visual diagram of the characteristics to tie the whole thing together as well as 
            fill a lot of the space I had in that corner.

        <h2>Sir David Attenborough</h2>
        <p>
          The celebrity I chose was Sir David Attenborough-most notably known as the narrator for most BBC Earth 
          documentaries. On May 8th of this year, Sir David Attenborough turned 95 years young and has inspired 
          and worked on conservation for more than 60 years. He has inspired so many people around the world with 
          his tenacity to bring the beauty of nature and education into our homes. In 1952, Sir David Attenborough 
          became a trainee at BBC then went on to his first hit series “Zoo Quest” and then more famously his 
          “Planet Earth” series which allowed us viewers a new perspective of the oceans. A BBC article stated, 
          “Sir David has always said he didn't start making programmes with conservation in mind - he simply enjoyed 
          observing the natural world. But as time passed, he became aware that the animals and habitats he was 
          filming were under threat” (BBC, 2019).
          When looking for a proper font that represents him, I thought I should look for fonts that were clean, 
          sophisticated because he is a narrator, and maybe something that looks like the network he is mostly found on. 
          So, after a little research, I found that BBC Earth used to use the font "Gill Sans" for years but in 2017 a 
          gentleman named Dalton Maag created a custom typeface family named after BBC’s first Director-General Lord Reith. 
          The font is named BBC Reith but a cool thing about this font family is that Maag made a sans, serif, and a 
          condensed serif version of this font in many different weights as well. I thought the sans version suited Attenborough 
          the most. The font was created to meet the demands of the 21st century in which identity and messages are needed to be effectively 
          felt across many different mediums such as posters and webpages. BBC Reith Sans has some very beautiful characteristics and attributes. 
          It is considered to be a contemporary humanist typeface because of each character’s fluctuating stroke widths that emulates a human’s script 
          handwriting (Bailey, 2018). The font has ascenders that go over the cap height, open counters and apertures, 
          terminals that cut at a 90-degree angle for example, a. It also has sharp connections and proportions that are regularized.
