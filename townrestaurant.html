              <h4>Table Tent</h4>
              <p class="text-muted">
                  To create the final design of the table tent, I had to think about how I wanted the project to look 
                  like as a whole. Once I had the idea in mind, I set to work in creating shapes that will be consistent 
                  throughout the designs. I also wanted to choose the right font to be the main font of choice. 
                  I went with LEMON MILK. I loved how the font look and I especially loved that it was a sans-serif 
                  font which I find, is easier to read. I played around with the orientation of the triangles until I 
                  was happy with its final locations. I decided to do a wine menu with the back portion of the table tent 
                  because I thought about the target audience for the brand, and I know that people of the upper-class do 
                  love their expensive wine.
                  <h3>Brochure</h3>
                  <p class="text-muted">
                    I wanted to keep the same styles of my other designs to continue to keep all 3 cohesive. 
                    I took my table tent design and incorporated it to the exterior side of the brochure. 
                    I used the same font (LEMON MILK) from both the table tent and the menu design in this brochure. 
                    I also used Times New Roman so that the LEMON MILK font wouldn’t look so dominating. I chose to 
                    put the vision and mission statement on the brochure because I think it is important that the 
                    client’s message would be seen by many people and hopefully entice new customers to enjoy their 
                    restaurant. For the interior of the brochure, I used my menu design to tie it all together. 
                    I included a short menu to give potential customers an idea of what the client serves. 
                    I think my brochure design has fully encompassed what the client wanted by keeping it classy and clean.

          <h4>Menu</h4>
          <p class="text-muted">
              In order to create this menu, I thought it was important for me to understand the direction I 
              was heading with my table tent first. I want everything to have a cohesive feel, so I made sure 
              I was very happy with my revisions first. After I figured out my final design for my table tent,
              I thought that it would be neat to continue the style through to the menu. I chose the colors 
              the client provided in their branding presentation so that I could embody the feel completely.
              The client’s mission is to “create experiential dining that is more than just a night out.” 
              They want to bring quality and luxury throughout their entire brand. With this information I 
              kept my design minimal, modern and sleek. Instead of adding images which I felt might take away 
              from the look I wanted, I decided to add some icons that looked good to represent the different 
              catalogues of food. I also altered the colors of each icon so that it keeps the design lively. 
              I continued the same font from my table tent design because I love the look of this sans-serif 
              font. It is very modern and just has a  nice look to it, as well as it is very easy to read. 
              I kept the layout as basic as possible. In my opinion, I think of high-class restaurants as very 
              minimalistic, so that is why I kept all my design decisions as minimal as I could.
